# What is DevSecOps?

This document is a snapshot of how I perceive the motivation, objectives and responsibilities within [DevSecOps](https://www.devsecops.org/). This document is a brain-dump from my perspective, which is why I welcome and appreciate **constructive feedback and criticism**.

## Methodology

Which methodologies go well with DevSecOps and are often found within companies living DevSecOps?

### Agile

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan
>
> \- Agile manifesto

### Lean

> Lean is both a philosophy and a discipline which, at its core, increases access to information to ensure responsible decision making in the service of creating customer value.
>
> \- Jim Benson, Modus Cooperandi
